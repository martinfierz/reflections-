* When I run git init to create a repository, git produces a .git folder in which all the info is stored about the history of my files.

* After git init, nothing is really done yet, there is no initial commit, and there are no files that git is tracking. 

* staging area is a bit like a sandbox where you can play around with things before doing an actual commit.

* I can use the staging area to add only that which belongs to a logical change, even if I made multiple changes in the working directory.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
* branches can help when you want to add a new feature but are not sure if it will work, you can keep a master copy that is not being touched. 
also I don't need to know the cryptic commit names but can checkout "master" or "experimental" instead.

diagrams show me what is reachable, and what the history was.
