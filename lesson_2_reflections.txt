* When I run git init to create a repository, git produces a .git folder in which all the info is stored about the history of my files.

* After git init, nothing is really done yet, there is no initial commit, and there are no files that git is tracking. 

* staging area is a bit like a sandbox where you can play around with things before doing an actual commit.

* I can use the staging area to add only that which belongs to a logical change, even if I made multiple changes in the working directory.
